This repo includes all code used for the analyses in my PhD main project, which looks at the impacts of maternal vegetarian/plant-based diets on pregnancy and perinatal health.

Some R-scripts/do-files were adapted from those originally developed by the MR-PREG team at the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol. Where applicable, acknowledgements have been included at the beginning of the script/do-file.

Key labels in filenames:
- ALSPAC: Code for analysing data from Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).
- BiB: Code for analysing data from Born in Bradford (BiB).
- MoBa: Code for analysing data from Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).
- Viva: Code for analysing data from Project Viva.
- ALL: Code for cross-study analyses (e.g., meta-analysis).
- VegDiet: Code for analyses of (binary/categorical) vegetarian diets.
- PDIs: Code for analyses of (continuous) plant-based diet indices.

Please note:
- Numbers in comments are just for quick check during coding and may not be up to date.
- I am definitely not a programming expert, and the code was built by iteratively extending earlier base versions over the past 4-5 years. Therefore, my code is not necessarily the most efficient and concise, but should at least be able to do its work!

Any questions/suggestions/comments are welcome :)
